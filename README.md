# ✈️  Overview

### _[QuickReport](https://e1ijah-c.github.io/QuickReport/)_ is a _GitHub Pages_ site with numerous features designed to streamline the reporting process for UAS operators committing offences. 

This project was made with the intention of decreasing communication downtime between OCC (Changi Airport) and the RSAF. With the fast-paced nature of UAS occurences, it is imperative that mutual situation awareness is achieved between these agencies.
